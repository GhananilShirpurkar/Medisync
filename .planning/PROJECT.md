# MediSync: Operating Theatre

## What This Is

A high-agency medical consultation interface for the MediSync platform. It employs a "Z-depth Stage" spatial metaphor to create a focused, high-stakes clinical environment where AI agents collaborate visibly with the practitioner.

## Core Value

**Spatial Intelligence**: Providing a coherent, navigable mental model of AI collaboration that feels authoritative and trustworthy in a medical context.

## Requirements

### Active

- [ ] Implement Stage Metaphor (max-width 560px, centered)
- [ ] Consolidate Left Background (Clinical Record + Intelligence Trace)
- [ ] Implement Typographic Duality (Jakarta Sans for Input, Garamond for Output)
- [ ] Develop Thermal Reveal Animations for IntelShelf cards
- [ ] Deploy Ambient Severity Feedback Loop
- [ ] Implement Session Continuity and completion sequence

## Context

This is a high-visibility demo for a hackathon. The UI must "wow" the judges with premium aesthetics and unique spatial logic while maintaining accessibility and clinical clarity.

## Constraints

- **Color**: NO PURPLE. Use neutral warm tones (sage, grey) with sharp red accents for criticality.
- **Layout**: Fixed 560px stage width to ensure background visibility on 1280px+ displays.
- **Typography**: Dual-personality system (Human vs Machine).

## Key Decisions

| Decision          | Rationale                                                        | Outcome |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Z-Depth Stage     | Focused attention on conversation while keeping process visible. | ✓ Good  |
| Jakarta for Input | Neutral, raw data feel.                                          | ✓ Good  |
| Garamond for AI   | Authoritative, Narrative feel.                                   | ✓ Good  |
