# 01-01-PLAN: Layout & Grid Foundation

Initialize the spatial architecture of the "Operating Theatre".

## Tasks

<task>
- [ ] **Create `TheatreLayout.jsx` Wrapper**
  - [ ] Implement three-zone grid: Left (Background), Center (Stage), Right (Background).
  - [ ] Center Column (Stage) must be `max-width: 560px`.
  - [ ] Left/Right zones fill remaining horizontal space.
  - [ ] Apply `z-index: 10` to the Stage to ensure foreground priority.
</task>

<task>
- [ ] **Implement Backdrop Logic in `StatusAmbience.jsx`**
  - [ ] Define severity-to-color mapping (Base: Neutral, Warn: Amber-shift, Critical: Red-shift).
  - [ ] Expose manual trigger for testing via `?severity=N` param or local state.
</task>

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Layout is responsive: on mobile (< 1000px), background zones compress while stage stays 560px or fills width.
- [ ] No purple hex codes in the new layout.
- [ ] `StatusAmbience` shifts color smoothly on severity change.

## Verification

- [ ] Manual check of `560px` stage constraint in dev tools.
- [ ] Screenshot comparison of different severity states.
