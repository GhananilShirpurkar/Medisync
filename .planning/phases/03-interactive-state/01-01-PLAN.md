# 03-01-PLAN: State & Animation Orchestration

Connect agent telemetry to the visual theatre and implement the "thermal print" reveal effect.

## Tasks

<task>
- [ ] **Create `IntelShelf.jsx` Component**
  - [ ] Implement three card slots: TRIAGE, MEDICAL, INVENTORY.
  - [ ] Default state: Hairline outlines with "WAITING" labels.
  - [ ] Active state: Staggered "thermal print" reveal (300ms intervals, high-severity first).
</task>

<task>
- [ ] **Connect Severity Triggers**
  - [ ] Update `Kiosk.jsx` to pass severity from Triage agent to `StatusAmbience`.
  - [ ] Ensure `IntelShelf` receives data from `currentOrder` or relevant work objects.
</task>

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Background shifts to red/amber automatically when critical/warn events occur.
- [ ] Cards reveal sequentially, never simultaneously.

## Verification

- [ ] Trigger mock severity 9; verify background shift.
- [ ] Verify 300ms stagger in shelf card animations.
