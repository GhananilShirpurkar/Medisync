# Roadmap: Operating Theatre UI

## Overview

From a static conversation view to a multi-layered, interactive clinical "theatre" that accumulates intelligence across sessions.

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundations & Spatial Architecture** - Locked stage proportions and background zone consolidation.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Typographic Systems & Information Streams** - Input/Output font split and Clinical Record/Trace logic.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Interactive State Transitions** - Thermal reveals, ambient triggers, and agent revelation logic.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Session Continuity & Final Polish** - Reset sequence, record appending, and final UX audit.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundations & Spatial Architecture

**Goal**: Establish the structural grid and the multi-layered z-depth metaphor.
**Success Criteria**:

1. Stage is fixed at 560px max-width.
2. Background is divided into Left (60%) and Right (40%) zones.
3. Ambient gradient responds to a manual severity override.
   **Plans**: 1 plan

### Phase 2: Typographic Systems & Information Streams

**Goal**: Implement the dual-typeface system and the combined vertical stream in the Left Zone.
**Success Criteria**:

1. User input renders in Plus Jakarta Sans.
2. AI output renders in Cormorant Garamond (Italic).
3. Left zone shows Clinical Record (top) and Intelligence Trace (bottom).
   **Plans**: 1 plan

### Phase 3: Interactive State Transitions

**Goal**: Connect agent outputs to the visual theatre via animations and state logic.
**Success Criteria**:

1. IntelShelf cards reveal with a staggered "thermal print" effect (300ms delay).
2. Background color shifts based on Triage/Drug-Conflict severity.
3. Critical Trace nodes render as 8px high-contrast dots.
   **Plans**: 1 plan

### Phase 4: Session Continuity & Final Polish

**Goal**: Finalize the demo flow for multi-query scenarios.
**Success Criteria**:

1. Clinical Record appends sessions with time dividers.
2. Room "settles" (darkening dividers, complete node) but remains interactive.
3. Reset state allows for a fresh consultation without screen clear.
   **Plans**: 1 plan
